# Robocar

This contains codebase of the earlier efforts using raspberry pi to create the autonomous capability. This runs on a framework called Robotic Operating System(ROS). The codebase contains ROS nodes that control the individual componets of the project and deep learning code for training the model.

This version is trying to make use of [NVIDIA's End to End Deep Learning](https://devblogs.nvidia.com/deep-learning-self-driving-cars/) concept.

Please read the [medium post](https://medium.com/intro-to-artificial-intelligence/self-driving-rc-car-using-robotic-operating-system-ros-c63a6d102c08) to understand the structure of the project further.
